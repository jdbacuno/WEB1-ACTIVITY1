              Eudora is a Light Elf who possesses a high level of magical
              talent, yet always loses control of her emotions because of her
              being discriminated against due to her Elf status. Later, she was
              discovered by the mentor of the Magic Academy, Theresa, who took
              her to the Magic Academy to study. Finally, she overcame the gloom
              in her heart and succeeded Theresa, becoming the dean of the
              Ulturia School.

              Tigreal is the rising star of the Moniyan Empire. But in a battle,
              the Second Army that he was leading went deep into the enemy
              territory alone under the orders of high-level officials and
              suffered heavy losses, for which Tigreal was eventually forced to
              take responsibility. Because of this, he left the Empire and came
              to the Northern Vale. During this period of time, Tigreal finally
              resolved the problems in his mind. Eventually, he returned to the
              Empire and became the leader of the Light's Order.

              Chou is a gifted martial artist born in slums. He learned the

              monk. He is agile and skilled in the use of the nunchaku.

              Once called Duan Meng and obsessed with kendo, Saber came to
              laboratory 1718 to transform himself in order to pursue
              perfection, but his memory was erased and he was turned into a
              killing machine. The torture of his memories drove him to finally
              destroy the laboratory and set off searching for the past.

              Miya lived in Azrya with the other Moon Elves. She stood aloof
              from worldly strife, and did not expect the Demon army would
              attack suddenly. In order to protect her homeland, Miya, as the
              Priestess of the Moon, led the other Moon Elves in a defense
              against foreign enemies.

              The Elf King who ruled the Moon Elves fell into a deep sleep after
              contracting a serious injury in the Second Plane War. When the
              Moon Elves were once again in imminent danger because of the
              awakening of the Abyss, he woke up early on a night of lightning
              and thunder.
